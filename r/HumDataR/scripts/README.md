#Exploring Humanities Data Types with R
A subset of the supplementary materials for the book
"Exploring Humanities Data Types with R".
See [humanitiesdata.org](http://humanitiesdata.org)

To run as-is, the scripts require users to set ExploringHumanitiesData/scripts/ as
the working directory via `setwd()` in the R console, and the required packages
must be installed. See Chapter 1 and Appenix A of the text for details.
